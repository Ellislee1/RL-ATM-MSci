This is an adaptation on my undergraduate 3rd year dissertation piece. The aim of this project is to adapt and improve my origional project to be cleaner and run in PyTorch.

## How To Use This Repo

To setup run `setup-python.bat` followed by `check.py`. To then run the system use the `Bluesky.py` - which will show the visual UI - or user the command: `python BlueSky.py --sim --detached --scenfile multi_agent.scn` from a console, this will automatically begine the training.
